``ngesh`` is a Python library and command-line tool for simulating
phylogenetic trees and related data (characters, states, branch length,
etc.). It is intended for benchmarking phylogenetic methods, especially
in historical linguistics and stemmatology. The generation of stochastic
phylogenetic trees also goes by the name of “simulation methods for
phylogenetic trees”, “synthetic data”, or just “phylogenetic tree
simulation”.
