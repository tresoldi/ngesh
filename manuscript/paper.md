# Summary

This work presents [`ngesh`](https://pypi.org/project/ngesh/), a Python library for simulating phylogenetic trees and data designed for research in Historical Linguistics and Stemmatics.
It generates reproducible stochastic simulations of evolution according to various criteria, including character mutation rates and lateral transmission probability. Many output formats are
supported and results can simulate inadequate data compilation. The library is designed for usage in development, debugging, and benchmarking of software pipelines and methods for phylogenetic inference.

# Background

Computational phylogenetics is being increasingly accepted in fields beyond biology, such as historical linguistics [@Bouckaert:2012] and stemmatics [@Robinson:2016].
Stochastic simulations, long advocated for natural sciences in general [@Bailey:1990] and
genetics in specific [@Foote:1999; @Harmon:2019], should be extended to these new approaches.
This way, evolutionary analogies and methods' performance can be
evaluated through vast amounts of simulated histories, without limits imposed by
data availability and collection time, along with quantifiable precision of results.
Simulations also allow basic fuzzy testing of software and
support studies on which evolutionary models, processes, and evolutionary parameters
better match observed phenomena.

The [`ngesh`](https://pypi.org/project/ngesh/) library is a tool
for setting up these kind of simulations, designed for easy
integration into phylogenetic pipelines. It can generate reproducible trees and
correlated data from random seeds, following both user-established parameters,
such as rates of birth and death, and constrains, such as branch
length and the node number. Character evolution related to the
tree topology can likewise be simulated, including *ex novo* mutations and
horizontal gene transfers. Results can be manipulated in diverse
manners, for example by pruning extinct leaves or simulating uneven sampling. The
library can label taxa in progression or randomly with either
names easy to pronounce (e.g. "Sume" and "Fekobir") or
binominal nomenclature-like (e.g. "Sburas wioris" and "Zurbata pusso").
The simulated trees are standard ETE3 objects [@ETE:2016] and may
be exported into different formats like Newick trees, ASCII-art representation,
and tabular lists.

The library is proposed as a building block for evaluating software pipelines.
It is a curated alternative to the basic technique of randomizing taxa
placement in existing cladograms, and to simpler tools such as the one by
@Noutahi:2017 or the `populate()` method of ETE3’s `Tree`
class [@ETE:2016]. Within its intended scope, it compares favorably to
popular alternatives, including the R `TreeSim` [@Stadler:2011] and `geiger`
packages [@Pennell:2014] and the `rtree()` function of `ape` [@Paradis:2018], because of
its specific support for historical linguistics and stemmatics,
as well of its availability as a stand-alone tool.

# Installation, Usage, & Examples

Users can install the library with the standard `pip` tool for managing Python packages. Trees can be generated from the command-line, defaulting to small phylogenies in Newick format:

```bash
$ ngesh
(Ukis:1.11985,(Koge:0.880823,(Rozkob:0.789548,(Meu:0.706601,
(((Felbuh:0.189693,Kefa:0.189693)1:0.117347,((Epib:0.153782,
Vugog:0.153782)1:0.0884745,Puluk:0.242256)1:0.0647836)1:0.0469885,
Efam:0.354028)1:0.352573)1:0.0829465)1:0.0912757)1:0.23903);
```

The tool supports both configuration files and command-line flags
that take precedence over the former. Here we specify a model to generate Nexus data
for a reproducible Yule tree, with a birth rate of 0.75, at least 5 leaves,
"human" labels, and 20 presence/absence features:

```bash
$ cat my_tree.conf
[Config]
labels=human
birth=0.75
death=0.0
output=nexus
min_leaves=5
num_chars=20
$ ngesh -c my_tree.conf --seed 12345
begin data;
  dimensions ntax=6 nchar=33;
  format datatype=standard missing=? gap=-;

Mukom     111110111011011011101001000100110
Pagil     111110110111011011100100100100110
Suglu     111110110111011011100011001001010
Wite      111110110111011011100101000100110
  ;
end;
```

Despite the benefit of a stand-alone tool, the package is designed to be run as a library.
The two primary functions are `gen_tree()`, which returns a random tree, and
`add_characters()`, which adds character evolution data to a tree. Users can therefore generate random trees without character information or simulate character evolution within existing trees, including non-simulated ones.

```python
>>> import ngesh
>>> tree = ngesh.gen_tree(1.0, 0.5, max_time=0.3, labels="bio",
                          seed="135")
>>> print(tree)

   /-Lubedsas larpes
--|
  |   /-Rasso wimapudda
   \-|
      \-Sbaes rapis
>>> print(tree.write())
(Lubedsas larpes:0.201311,(Rasso wimapudda:0.0894405,Sbaes rapis:0.0894405)
1:0.11187);
>>> tree = ngesh.add_characters(tree, 15, 2.0, 0.5)
```

Besides the `write()` method of the example above, which outputs Newick trees, results can be exported in NEXUS format with the `tree2nexus()` function and in tabular output, appropriate for BEASTling [@Maurits:2017], with `tree2wordlist()`.
